# Analysis of High-Density Parking Areas in Milan  
*Urban mobility analysis project using GPS Tracks*

## Introduction

In modern cities, managing and optimizing parking is essential for improving mobility and overall quality of life. This project focuses on Milan, Italy, where simulated GPS trajectory data from private vehicles is analyzed to detect areas with high stop densityâ€”potential parking zones. The goal is to identify neighborhoods with a high demand for parking, providing insights for urban planning and infrastructure improvements.

## Motivation

My primary motivation for this project was to understand and learn how to use the libraries involved, such as **scikit-mobility**, **GeoPandas**, and **Folium**. I wanted to introduce myself to the field of geospatial data analysis and urban mobility studies while gaining hands-on experience with these powerful tools. This exploration has enabled me to see firsthand how various Python libraries can be integrated to analyze and visualize complex mobility data.

## Methodology

The analysis was conducted through several key steps:

1. **Loading and Visualizing Geospatial Data**  
   - Imported a geographic tessellation of Milan's neighborhoods.
   - Customized the map style to highlight polygon borders and background.
   - Map of Milan with tessellation:

2. **Processing Mobility Data**  
   - Loaded the GPS data (latitude, longitude, date, and time) of private vehicles.
   - Filtered trajectories to remove points with speeds greater than 150 km/h, ensuring data quality.
   - Applied spatial compression to reduce noise and focus on the core mobility patterns.

3. **Stop Detection and Clustering**  
   - Detected stops for each user using criteria such as a minimum stop duration of 30 minutes and a spatial radius of 0.3 km.
   - Applied clustering to group nearby stops, identifying high-density parking zones.
   - In the map it is displayed a clusterization of the stops areas:

4. **Mapping and Visualization**  
   - Mapped each stop to the neighborhood tessellation, visualizing stop locations within the city.
   - Created interactive maps using [Folium](https://python-visualization.github.io/folium/), showing individual stops and clusters.
   - Developed a choropleth map to illustrate the number of GPS points per neighborhood, providing a clear view of parking demand across Milan.
   - In the following map we can see the amount of stops in each neighborhood:

## Results and Discussion

- **Understanding the Tools:**  
  This project allowed me to delve into the functionalities of various Python libraries, understand how they interact, and see their application in real-world data analysis scenarios.

- **Identification of Critical Areas:**  
  Interactive maps reveal zones with a high density of stops, indicating potential areas where additional parking infrastructure could be beneficial.

- **Temporal and Spatial Analysis:**  
  By grouping stops and analyzing the average duration, the study not only identifies the locations but also the significance of each area based on usage. This analysis suggests that some neighborhoods might benefit from either temporary or long-term parking solutions.

- **Intuitive Visualizations:**  
  The integration of geospatial visualization techniques ensures that the information is accessible and easy to understand, aiding urban planners and municipal authorities in decision-making.  
  **Visual Suggestion:** Supplement the discussion with time-series charts showing stop duration distributions per cluster to further illustrate temporal patterns.

## Conclusions

This study not only demonstrates the potential of mobility data to address critical urban challenges but also serves as a learning journey into geospatial data analysis. By identifying high-density parking areas in Milan, the project guides infrastructure planning towards neighborhoods that need it most while providing practical insights into using powerful Python libraries. The experience gained here lays a strong foundation for future explorations in urban mobility studies.
